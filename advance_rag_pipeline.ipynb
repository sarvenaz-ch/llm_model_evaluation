Along the way, she encounters a thorn that traps her in her scarlet cloak. A mysterious figure helps her free from the thorn, but Little Red Riding Hood doesn't realize that it is the Big Bad Wolf. She continues on her journey and arrives at her grandmother's cottage, only to find that the wolf has already eaten her grandmother and disguised himself as her. Little Red Riding Hood realizes the truth and screams for help. The Wise Owl sends the Storyland Vets, who put the wolf to sleep and rescue the grandmother. In the end, the wolf is left with the grandmother's two pointy shoes inside him, which cause him discomfort whenever he feels hungry.\n"
